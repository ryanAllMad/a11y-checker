A11y Check will help you check your posts for common accessibility pitfalls.

## Description

A11y Check will check your content for issues with WCAG(Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). A11y Check also instructs you on which WCA Guidelines to watch out for and how to pass them. Below shows how this plugin works.

### Images
This video shows a post with 2 images that are missing alternative text. The "Images Without Text Alternative" section shows a list of image files without a text alternative. The mouse adds alt text to one of the images, and it is removed from the list.  There is a checkbox next to each image file to choose if the image is decorative. The mouse in the video below marks one of the images as decorative.

### Headings
This video shows a post with headings that are not descriptive and out of order. In the "Headings are descriptive and in order" section, the mouse clicks the "Show headings" button under the heading "we found headings on the page". When "Show headings" is clicked, the heading blocks in the post editor will be outlined. Next the mouse scrolls down and clicks the "Open Document Outlin" button under the "Headings are out of order" heading.

### Links
In this last video, under the "Links are descriptive and not redundant" heading, the user can click "Show links" to highlight the links on the page and determine if the link text is descriptive. Once they're done they can mark the checkbox.
